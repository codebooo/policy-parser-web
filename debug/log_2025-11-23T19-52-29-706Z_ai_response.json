    "summary": "Google's privacy policy details an extensive data collection ecosystem that powers its services and advertising business. While it offers users powerful tools to manage their data, the default settings and the combination of information from across all services, devices, and third-party partner sites pose significant privacy risks. Key concerns include the potential for indefinite data retention unless users actively manage settings and broad cross-site tracking for ad personalization. Positively, Google commits not to use content from personal services like Gmail, Drive, and Photos or sensitive categories like race and health for advertising purposes, which is a critical user protection.",
