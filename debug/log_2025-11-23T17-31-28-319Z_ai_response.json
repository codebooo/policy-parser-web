It clearly outlines the categories of data collected, such as identifiers, commercial information, and internet activity. While the company commendably states it does not sell personal information, it engages in targeted advertising on third-party sites. Key areas of concern include the lack of a specific data retention schedule and a clause stating that continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of any policy changes, which undermines explicit user consent.",
